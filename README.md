# Astronomy Picture Day

Let's try to get the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA'S API `APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day`

## Tech used
- Styling done with [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- Spinner taken from [Loading.io](https://loading.io/css/)
- [Apollo React Hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/) for state management and fetching data


### Motivation
I love space related stuff and looking into pictures from space is always nice, I wanted to also try `apollo-link-rest` with hooks.

Todo: better UI, saving favorite pictures and a prettier date picker.
